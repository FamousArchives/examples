## License

All the code in the `src/examples` folder is licensed under the [MIT license][mit-license]. This is basically a better MIT license since it removes the ambiguous language from the original MIT.

The famous framework source code found in `/src/famous` is a git submodule cloned from the [famous/famous][famous-repo] git repo, and is licensed only under the MPL-2.0 license. More information about the licensing of that code can be found in the original repo.
